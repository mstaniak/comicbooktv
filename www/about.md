### How to use this App


Netflix shows are treated differently than other shows because of Netflix's buissness model.
All the episodes are released on one day, so the time has no effect

### About the data

The data was scrapped from three sources:

* [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com) (user ratings, air dates, titles, channels)
* [wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org) (Nielsen ratings and number of viewers for shows other than Arrow)
* [tvseriesfinale](http://www.tvseriesfinale.com) (ratings for Arrow).

IMDb ratings are user submitted.  
 
Nielsen ratings are harder to understand

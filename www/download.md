### About the data

All shows based on DC or Marvel comicbooks that aired on TV or Netflix since 2012 are presented.  
IMDb ratings were chosen because of popularity (see [www.ale.com/siteinfo/imdb.com](alexa rank))
and easy access to user-submitted ratings for each episode through IMDb's text file database.  
Nielsen ratings are usually reported in the form ratings/share.
Ratings represent percentage of all television household that watched the episode of the show.
Share wasn't used in this app. 
These are basic numbers that describe live viewership.
They don't include DVR, Hulu, etcf
So called +3 or +7 ratings are interesting, but not as available.

The data comes from three sources:

* [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com) 
* [wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org) 
* [tvseriesfinale](http://www.tvseriesfinale.com)
